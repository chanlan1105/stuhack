Stuack is a chrome extension for www.studocu.com to get free premium features.

This repository is forked from [isanchop/stuhack](https://github.com/isanchop/stuhack). I do not own the original code, but I have introduced my own modifications and adaptations to improve its usability. 

## Features:
  
- Premium banner remove
- Blur pass
- Documents download

    
    
## Documents Download:
  
1) If document is longer than 20 pages scroll down till the end of the document in order to load it (Notice if you go too fast won't load some images)
2) Press the Download button to get a document preview in another tab
3) Press Ctrl + P in the new tab in order to print. Then select print document in pdf 



## Installation:
1. `git clone` this repository.
2. Go to the extensions menu on Google Chrome (chrome://extensions/)
3. Enable "Developer Mode" on the top right
4. Press "Load Unpacked" on the top left
5. Select the folder containing this extension

- Simplify download button and prevent it from triggering the paywall action along with the download preview
